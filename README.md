Financial Income Statement Report
an interactive Income Statement (Profit & Loss / P&L) dashboard as part of advanced Financial Reporting. (See attached screenshot)

Key features of the dashboard:
• Real-time monitoring of revenue, expenses, and net profit with clear Actual vs Budget variance analysis.
• Monthly & quarterly trend analysis with executive snapshots.
• Efficient financial data model supporting various financial reports.
• Advanced DAX measures and customizable reports tailored to management and departmental needs.

This project reflects my passion for combining financial analysis with interactive visualizations, enhancing decision-making and transforming the Financial Reporting experience.
